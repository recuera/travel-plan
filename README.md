# revella


Revella is a web application that helps people planning their trip to a city. 
After you create a new trip you can add all the visits that you want to do in the timeline view. 
Revella will let you know how long your visits will take, so you don't end up with an unrealistic planning.
There is also a map view, where you will see all the visits of one day placed in a map. This will help you to rearrange your visits in order to spend as less time as possible moving around the city.

Revella was my final project at Ironhack, done with MEAN Stack after 7 weeks of learning JavaScript!
